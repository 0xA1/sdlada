SDLAda
======

This is a new variable thickness Ada 2012 binding to SDL 2.x.y. This means that things are wrapped when
they need to be into a thicker binding and those things that can just be imported, are.

There will still be a need to use conditional compilation for the various platforms as there will be
some platform specifics which cannot be abstracted out leanly, but this will be reduced as much as possible.

The bindings are only generated for the specific parts of SDL which Ada does not already have support for, i.e.
threads are not bound as Ada has tasking support built in.

Usage, Licence & Attribution
============================

SDLAda is distributed under the same zlib licence as the SDL libary is. You may use this library as in any way
you like whether free or commercial. I would add that whilst you don't have to state that your game uses this
library, I would prefer it if you did, in fact, I'm asking you to.

Possible TODO's
===============

Anything listed here is a question of whether it's required.

* Do we need to hook into the Assert module? To raise an exception maybe?
